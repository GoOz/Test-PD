I chose to do vanilla HTML & CSS for 2 reasons :

- It didn't seem relevant spending time doing a complicated setup with a local environment, templates & a CSS pre-processessor for such a small project.
- It's been a while since I did vanilla HTML & CSS and I thought it would be fun to do it again. ðŸ˜„
