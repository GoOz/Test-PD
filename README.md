# Test-PD
Recruitment test for People Doc

## Comments
I chose to do vanilla HTML & CSS for 2 reasons :

- It didn't seem relevant spending time doing a complicated setup with a local environment, templates & a CSS pre-processessor for such a small project.
- It's been a while since I did vanilla HTML & CSS and I thought it would be fun to do it again. 😄

## Support
Last version of Firefox, Chrome & Safari.

## Bonus Points

- ✅ Differents states of interactive elements
- ✅ Responsiveness
- ✅ JS interactivity
- ❌ IE11 Compatibility (I don't have the right tools on my personal computer to do this properly)
